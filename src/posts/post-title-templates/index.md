Do you know POST TITLE is one of the most important things to attract people? That’s why experts create post title templates to easily generate great titles. Almost marketers are using them for SEO and advertising purposes.

Having a catchy title is the key to grabbing people’s attention. It’s your golden ticket to increased traffic and wider audience.

You need to elicit interest, emotion, and curiosity in your potential readers to make your blog post title as irresistible as possible.

Plus, it plays a significant role in improving your search ranking.

For example, you’re writing an article about starting a website, instead of using “Creating A Website” as a blog title, you’d want to write “How To Start A Website in 3 Easy Steps” or “How To Start A Website in Less Than 20 Minutes” instead.

Not only it’s more attractive, your post also gets a higher chance of landing in the first pages in the search results since it’s more specific and there’s less competition for the latter phrase (a.k.a long tail keywords) than the former.

You get it.

So be creative. Be intriguing.

We all know the importance of a great post title, but how can we really achieve this?

## 6 Quick Tips For Writing Titles

Before you can actually write a great headline, you need to know the principles, tips, and guides behind. There are different ways that you can come up with an attention-grabbing title, but the fundamental principles remain the same.

1. **Use catchy adjective words.** Add some color to your title. The stronger and thought-provoking your adjectives are, the better you get people to take action.

2. **Use numbers.** Start off your title with numbers. It draws people’s attention. It’s a great way to tell your audience how much exactly they’re going to get. Studies show that digits work better than words (So instead of writing “five”, write “5”).

3. **Use popular search queries** such as ashow-to, what is. Generally speaking, people are looking for something useful and relevant. Plus, most searchers look for HOW-TO and WHAT-IS post. Beside catching people’s attention, including “how to” or “what is” in your post title will also attract the search engines.

4. **Keep it short and focused.** An effective title is short enough can convey the best message possible. The post title must be concise, but at the same time descriptive. Don’t forget to include keywords for SEO and avoid jargons. I prefer using less than 70 characters since Google cuts off titles longer than that. Use a meta length counter to check your title count!

5. **Never mislead.** If your post title doesn’t coincide with the main message of your post, you’ll lose credibility and tarnish your reputation. While it might be tempting to manipulate your title just to get more attention, it’ll only hurt your blog in the future. Not to mention that search engine will eventually ignore your site because your title does not match with its content.

6. **Don’t limit yourself.** Read and listen to other people, but you should never lose your uniqueness in the process. Be creative!
